TL;DR: A quantum computer lets you provably build more general Bernoulli factories than your laptop. 

I have grown an interest for quantum computing, both for fun and because it naturally applies to sampling my favourite distribution, [determinantal point processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15851).
One of the natural (and still quite open) big questions in quantum computing is, for a given computational task such as solving a linear system, whether having access to a quantum computer gives you any *advantage* over using your laptop in the smartest way possible.
Maybe the quantum computer lets you solve part of your problem faster, or maybe it allows you to solve a more general class of problems.
[Dale, Jennings, and Rudolph (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9203) prove a quantum advantage of the latter kind, for a task that appeals to a computational statistician: a quantum computer gives you access to strictly more Bernoulli factories than your laptop does.
In this post, I discuss one of their examples.

## Bernoulli factories

First, I need to define what a Bernoulli factory is.
Loosely speaking, a Bernoulli factory is an algorithm that, when fed with i.i.d draws from a Bernoulli random variable $B(p)$ with unknown parameter $p$, outputs a stream of independent Bernoullis with parameter $f(p)$.
The algorithm does not have access to the value of $p$, and needs to work for as large a range of values of $p$ as possible.
For instance, a trick attributed to von Neumann gives you a Bernoulli factory for the constant function $f\equiv 1/2$, can you guess how? If you have never seen this trick, take a break and think about it. Here is a hint: try to pair Bernoulli draws and define two events of equal probability.

The problem of determining what Bernoulli factories can be constructed on a *classical* (as opposed to *quantum*) computer has been answered by [Keane and O'Brien (1994)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/175007.175019).
Essentially, it is necessary and sufficient that $(i)$ $f$ be continuous on its domain $\mathcal{P}$, and that $(ii)$ either $f$ is constant or there exists an integer $n$ such that, for all $p\in\mathcal{P}$,
$$
    \min[ f(p), 1-f(p)] \geq \min [ p^n, (1-p)^n ].
$$
In particular, a non-constant $f$ should not take the values $0$ or $1$ in $(0,1)$, and cannot approach these extreme values too fast.
In particular, the doubling function $f_\mathrm{double}:p\mapsto 2p$ defined on $[0,1/2]$ does not correspond to a Bernoulli factory, while its restriction to $[0,1/2-\epsilon]$ does, for any $\epsilon>0$. 
Another simple example is 
$$
    f_\mathrm{quadratic}:p\mapsto 4p(1-p)
$${#eq-quadratic} 
defined on $[0,1]$, which does not correspond to a Bernoulli factory.
Yet, the rest of the post shows that $f_\mathrm{quadratic}$ does correspond to a specific weakening of the notion of Bernoulli factory, one that is natural in quantum computing.

## Quantum computers and quantum coins
Now buckle up, because I need to define a mathematical model for a quantum computer. 
This model only requires basic algebra, albeit with strange notation.
Let $N$ be a positive integer, and 
$$
    \mathbb{H} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes N} = \mathbb{C}^2\otimes \dots \otimes \mathbb{C}^2,
$$ 
where the tensor product is taken $N$ times.
An $N$-qubit quantum computer is a machine that, when fed with 

1. a positive semi-definite, Hermitian operator $\rho$ acting on $\mathbb{H}$, with trace norm $1$ (the *state*),
2. a Hermitian operator $A$ on $\mathbb{H}$ (the *observable*), 
   
outputs a draw from the random variable $X_{A,\rho}$, with support included in the spectrum of $A$, defined by 
$$
    \mathbb{E} g(X_{A,\rho}) = \mathrm{Tr}(\rho g(A)), \quad g:\mathbb{H}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+.
$${#eq-born}
Here $g(A)$ is the operator that has the same eigenvectors as $A$, but where each eigenvalue $\lambda$ is replaced by $g(\lambda)$.
The correspondence in @eq-born between a state-observable pair and a probability distribution on the spectrum of the observable is a cornerstone of quantum physics called _Born's rule_, and it is the only bit of quantum theory we shall need.
In other words, we see a quantum computer as a procedure to draw from probability distributions parametrized by state-observable pairs.
We give two fundamental examples of such state-observable pairs, which can be respectively interpreted as describing one quantum coin and two quantum coins.

_The quantum coin._
Consider a one-qubit computer, i.e. $N=1$. 
Then $\mathbb{H} = \mathbb{C}^2$ has dimension $2$, and we fix an orthonormal basis, which we denote by $(\ket{0}, \ket{1})$.
The strange notation $\ket{\cdot}$ is inherited from physics, and is very practical in computations, as you will see. 
In short, denote by $\braket{\cdot\vert\cdot}$ (a *bracket*, or *bra-ket*) the inner product in $\mathbb{H}$. 
Now, a vector in $\mathbb{H}$ is written $\ket{v}$ (a *ket*). 
Similarly, define the linear form $\bra{v}$ (a *bra*) by
$$
    \bra{v}: \ket{u} \mapsto \braket{v\vert u}.
$$
By construction, we can write things like
$$
\bra{v} \ket{u} = \braket{v\vert u},
$$
so that the bra-ket notation for linear forms and vectors is consistent with the inner product.

Now, remember we have fixed a basis $(\ket{0}, \ket{1})$ of $\mathbb{H}$. 
For $p\in[0,1]$, we define
$$
    \ket{p} = \sqrt{1-p} \ket{0} + \sqrt{p}\ket{1}.
$$
This definition is consistent with earlier notation, as $\ket{p} = \ket{0}$ when $p=0$, for instance. 
Now, we define a quantum coin as the state $\rho_{\mathrm{qc}} = \ket{p}\bra{p}$.
It is the projection onto $\mathbb{C}\ket{p}$, and in particular it is a positive semi-definite, Hermitian operator of trace $1$, and hence a valid state.
As observable, we take the projection onto the second vector of the basis, which we denote in the bra-ket notation by $\ket{1}\bra{1}$.
What random variable $X_{\ket{1}\bra{1}, \rho_{\mathrm{qc}}}$ does this state-observable pair define in @eq-born? 

Well, the spectrum of the observable is $\{0,1\}$, so we have defined a Bernoulli random variable.
Moreover, the probability that it is equal to $1$ is given by taking $g:\lambda\mapsto \mathbf{1}_{\lambda=1}$ in @eq-born, yielding
$$
    \mathbb{P}(X_{\ket{1}\bra{1}, \rho_{\mathrm{qc}}} = 1) = \mathrm{Tr}\left[ \ket{1}\bra{1} \ket{p}\bra{p}  \right] = \vert \braket{1\vert p}\vert^2 = p.
$$
by cyclicity of the trace. 
All of this to define a $B(p)$ variable!
Things get more interesting when you try to create two dependent Bernoulli variables.

_Two quantum coins._
Consider now a computer with two qubits, so that the Hilbert space is $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$. 
From our orthonormal basis $(\ket{0}, \ket{1})$ of $\mathbb{C}^2$, we can build an orthonormal basis $(\ket{i}\otimes\ket{j}, i,j\in\{0,1\})$ of $\mathbb{H}$. 
To keep expressions short, it is customary to write $\ket{i}\otimes\ket{j}$ as $\ket{ij}$. 
To define a pair of quantum coins, we now consider the tensor product of two quantum coins,
$$
    \ket{p}\otimes \ket{p} = (1-p) \ket{00} + \sqrt{p(1-p)}\ket{01} + \sqrt{p(1-p)}\ket{10}+ p \ket{11}.
$$
We think of the corresponding state $\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}} = (\ket{p}\otimes \ket{p})(\bra{p}\otimes \bra{p})$ as two quantum coins.
Now consider for your observable an operator $B$ with four distinct eigenvalues, say $\lambda_{ij} \in\mathbb{C}$ for $i, j\in\{0,1\}$, each corresponding to eigenvector $\ket{ij}$.
In other words, the spectral decomposition of $B$ is 
$$
    B = \sum_{i, j\in\{0,1\}} \lambda_{ij} \ket{ij}\bra{ij}.
$$
The random variable $X_{B, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$, associated through @eq-born to two quantum coins and our newly defined observable $B$, has support in
$$
    \{\lambda_{00}, \lambda_{01}, \lambda_{10}, \lambda_{11}\}.
$$
Moreover, taking $g:\lambda\mapsto \mathbf{1}_{\lambda=\lambda_{ij}}$ in @eq-born, we obtain
$$
    \mathbb{P}(X_{B, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}} = \lambda_{ij}) = \mathrm{Tr}\left[(\ket{p}\otimes \ket{p})(\bra{p}\otimes \bra{p}) \ket{ij}\bra{ij}\right] = p^{i}(1-p)^{1-i} \times p^{j}(1-p)^{1-j}, 
$$
again by cyclicity of the trace and then carefully distributing our multiplication, noting that most terms are zero by orthogonality.
Otherly put, the indices of $X_{B, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$ are a pair of independent Bernoullis with equal parameter $p$. 
Again, this might feel like a lot of algebraic pain for no gain, but wait for it.

What if we had taken the same state, but with another observable? Say the observable with four distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_{\phi^+}, \lambda_{\phi-}, \lambda_{\psi+}, \lambda_{\psi-}\in \mathbb{C}$, and corresponding eigenvectors
$$
    \ket{\phi^{\pm}} = \frac{\ket{00}\pm\ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad
    \ket{\psi^{\pm}} = \frac{\ket{01}\pm\ket{10}}{\sqrt{2}}.
$$
Then, the random variable $X_{C, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$ defined by Born's rule in @eq-born is supported in 
$$
    \{\lambda_{\phi^+}, \lambda_{\phi-}, \lambda_{\psi+}, \lambda_{\psi-}\},
$$
with
$$
    \mathbb{P}(X_{C, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}} = \lambda_{\phi^+}) = \mathrm{Tr\left[ \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}} \ket{\phi^+}\bra{\phi^+} \right]} = \vert (\bra{p}\otimes\bra{p})\ket{\phi^+} \vert^2 = \frac12.
$$
Similarly, 
$$
    \mathbb{P}(X_{C, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}} = \lambda_{\phi^-}) = \vert (\bra{p}\otimes\bra{p})\ket{\phi^-} \vert^2 = \frac{(2p-1)^2}{2},
$$
$$
    \mathbb{P}(X_{C, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}} = \lambda_{\psi^+}) = \vert (\bra{p}\otimes\bra{p})\ket{\psi^+} \vert^2 = 2p(1-p),
$$
and
$$
    \mathbb{P}(X_{C, \rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}} = \lambda_{\psi^-}) = \vert (\bra{p}\otimes\bra{p})\ket{\psi^-} \vert^2 = 0.
$$
You can check that the four probabilities sum to $1$.
This time, if you map, e.g., $\phi_+$ to the string $00$, $\phi^-$ to $11$, $\psi^+$ to $01$, and $\psi^-$ to $10$, we no longer have independent Bernoulli draws, but a rather strange correlation structure. 
We shall see that $X_{C,\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$ allows us to build a Bernoulli factory that is beyond the reach of a classical computer.

## A quantum Bernoulli factory
Imagine the following procedure.
Draw the random variable $X_{C,\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$. 
If you obtain $\lambda_{\phi^-}$ or $\lambda_{\psi^+}$, then stop, and respectively output $0$ and $1$.
Otherwise, draw another independent realization of $X_{C,\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$, etc.
This is reminiscent of the von Neumann trick we mentioned earlier. 
What have we achieved? 
Well, the output is a Bernoulli draw with parameter
$$
    \frac{2p(1-p)}{2p(1-p)+\frac{(2p-1)^2}{2}} = 4p(1-p).
$$
Repeating the procedure as many times as you want draws, we thus have a Bernoulli factory for $f_{\mathrm{quadratic}}$ in @eq-quadratic, which we know to be beyond the reach of classical Bernoulli factories!

The difference is that our Bernoulli factory is a _quantum_ Bernoulli factory.
In particular, our basic resource is (physically) independent copies of $\ket{p}$.
This is asking for strictly more than (statistically) independent Bernoulli draws. Indeed, depending on your observable, two physically independent copies of $\ket{p}$ can give you two i.i.d. Bernoullis $X_{B,\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$, or something more complicated like $X_{C,\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$.
If you accept that the cost of preparing the two types of inputs, i.i.d. Bernoullis $B(p)$ on one side and physically independent copies of $\ket{p}$ on the other side, then you have a quantum advantage.
It might be a big assumption, but I find it easier to swallow than similar caveats in other quantum advantages that I've read about.

## Further remarks
The example in this post is from the paper by [Dale, Jennings, and Rudolph (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9203).
The authors further characterize the Bernoulli factories that you can build with only single-qubit operations: they strictly include classical Bernoulli factories and the example from this post. 
In other words, it is not necessary to use pairs of qubits to build $X_{C,\rho_{2\mathrm{qc}}}$. 
Since then, there has been more work on quantum Bernoulli factories, for instance considering [quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09817), where the goal is to create independent copies of $\ket{f(p)}$ rather than a stream of Bernoulli random variables.

I thank my [group](http://rbardenet.github.io/#group) for valuable comments during the writing of this post. 
One non-consensual point is that I have tried to reduce the quantum formalism to the correspondence in @eq-born between a state-observable pair and a random variable. 
This has the advantage of keeping the necessary algebra to a minimum, but it forced me to introduce rather abstract observables, with a spectrum that we only use through its indices.
A more standard (but arguably lengthier) treatment might have involved [projection-valued measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection-valued_measure).
